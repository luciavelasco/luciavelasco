# hi 🍄

I'm **Lucia (she/her)**, I'm a **Senior JavaScript developer** with about a decade of experience across the stack, in various programming paradigms and with a range of libraries. **React** is my bread and butter; most of my recent work has been large-scale data visualisation in React with Node APIs. I also provide consultancy and individual mentoring; I have a track record of successful process implementation, delivering improved code quality and increased velocity at a range of companies (from early-stage startups to global household names).

I'm currently available for hire! You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucia-velasco/). 

In my spare time I:
- write stories 📝
- play D&D and other TTRPG games 🐉 🧝‍♀️ 📜 
- do digital art 👩‍💻
- work out 🏋️‍♀️
- sew 🪡
- garden 🍂
- cook (and, more importantly, eat) 🍙
